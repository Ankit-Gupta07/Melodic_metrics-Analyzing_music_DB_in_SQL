# Melodic_metrics-Analyzing_music_DB_in_SQL
This project mainly focuses on solving few different business problems which are categorised  into three levels - Easy, Medium and Hard. Each level has some questions which will be answered by fetching relevant results from the provided database.

NOTE: Since I have used the free version of Google BigQuery for fetching required data from the RDBMS environment (using SQL) - there will be no .sql files present in this repository but you will still be able to find all the relevant information (in form of other formated-files).
